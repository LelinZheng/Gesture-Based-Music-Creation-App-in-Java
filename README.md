# Gesture-Based Music Creation App in Java

## Overview

The Gesture-Based Music Creation App is an innovative tool that allows users to compose music using gesture recognition, significantly enhancing user engagement compared to traditional button-based inputs. The application incorporates over 20 musical elements, including notes, rests, bars, and staff, providing a flexible and interactive interface for music composition.

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition**: Utilize gestures to create musical elements such as notes, rests, bar lines, and staff, streamlining the composition process.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An interactive design that enhances the user experience and engagement.
- **OOP Principles**: Implemented extensive Object-Oriented Programming principles to ensure modularity and code reusability.
- **Performance Improvement**: Achieved a 60% increase in speed for music composition compared to traditional methods, allowing for quicker and more efficient creative expression.

## How It Works

The app uses gesture recognition technology to interpret user movements, converting them into musical elements. This allows users to compose music intuitively and creatively without the limitations of traditional input methods. The underlying framework supports a variety of gestures, making it easy to create complex compositions.
